## Data Transformation/Modelling

After extracting Adventure Works dataset, I launched it into Power Bi and import each tables. After importing each tables, I loaded it into Power Query Editor and performed some cleaning on the dataset like renaming, replacing values, checking for duplicates and null values. I merged the sales tables for 2020, 2021 and 2022 and renamed it Sales data. After cleaning the dataset, I make sure the dataset is 100% valid then I close and apply. Then proceeded to the Model view to ensure that the data was modelled properly. I create connection between the tables using many to one relationship. The schema for this project is a Snow-flake schema.

## Data Schema

## D.A.X (Data Analysis Expression)

I created a new table called Measures for all the calculated measures used for this analysis.
![](Measures_Used.png)
I created a new measure named Bike Returns to calculate the total Quantity of bikes returned. After which I created a matrix to show Bike Returns(values) by Start of Month(rows). I also create a new measure named Bike Sales to calculate the total quantity of bikes sold.

## Building Reports
Bookmarks is a feature in Power BI that enables users to save a particular view of a report page. The Selection Pane is a feature that allows you to control the visibility and selection of various report elements in your report page. The selection pane can also be used to hide/unhide visuals on a report page.
I used Bookmarks and Selection for layering of visuals and use them in Actions as per suitability.

I also used Drill-through keep all filters, cross-page (Drill through filters allow users to navigate to a specific report page, pre-filtered on the item selected).
![](Drillthrough_map.png)
I used the buttons to represent each page in order to navigate to each page.
The visuals I used in creating these reports are: Cards, KPIs, Matrix, Table, Slicers, Map, Donut chart, Line charts, Gauge, Clustered bar chart.

**I created four reports:**
- **Executive Report**
- **Customer details**
- **Product details**
- **Map**
